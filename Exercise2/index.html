 <p>If you've noticed changes in your cat's behavior lately, it's possible that she's feeling stressed. What we perceive as stressful and what a cat sees as stressful can be quite different, and it doesn't take much to disturb her peace of mind. Changes to her routine, a stray in the garden, a new brand of cat litter, an owner going on holiday, or a trip to the vetâ€”all these can potentially trigger an upset. Not only is stress unpleasant for her (and you), but it can also cause health problems by reducing immunity, increasing inflammation, and leading to over-grooming. For these reasons, it's easy to see why it is important to reduce stress as much as possible for your cat.</p >

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Observe changes in urination.</strong></li>
          <p>Urinary discomfort is a common result of stress in cats. The stress hormones cause the bladder lining to become inflamed, which results in physical symptoms. Keep track of how often your cat visits the tray. Signs of a problem include more frequent urination, discomfort while urinating, and possible blood in the urine.</p >
            <ul>
             <li>These signs should never be ignored; always get the cat checked by a vet.[2] This is because bladder inflammation can lead to a blockage, which is a serious, and potentially life-threatening, problem if untreated.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>

        <li><strong>Notice if your cat is over-grooming.</strong></li>
          <p>Stressed cats tend to over-groom, indeed they can wash so much that they lick bald patches in their coat. Favorite spots to over-groom include the tummy, inner thighs, and front legs. The action of licking releases natural morphine-like substances which help to comfort the cat and make her feel more secure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Again, get your cat checked by the vet before concluding this is stress-related (allergies and parasites can also cause over-grooming).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        <li><strong>Look out for diarrhea.</strong></li>
          <p>Some cats become so distressed that it upsets their stomachs and they develop diarrhea. Regardless of the causes (stress or an infection), get your cat checked by a veterinarian, because medication may be needed to settle the upset stomach.</p>
           <br>

          <img src="images/image4.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 4.">

        <li><strong>Notice if your cat is urinating or defecating outside the litter box. </strong></li>
          <p>The cat may do this either because she feels too stressed to visit the tray, or in order to spread her scent around the house, which makes her feel more secure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>However, other problems such as arthritis, bladder infections, or stomach upsets can mimic this, so always get your cat's health checked by the vet.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <img src="images/image5.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 5.">

        <li><strong>Decide if your cat is meowing or verbalizing excessively.</strong></li>
          <p>Some cats become very clingy to their owner and try to attract their attention by talking.</p>
          <br>

          <img src="images/image6.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 6.">

        <li><strong>Be aware that restlessness is also a sign of stress. </strong></li>
          <p>A stressed cat may not be able to settle and may pace restlessly, patrolling her territory on the watch for a perceived threat.</p>
          <br>

          <img src="images/image7.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 7.">

        <li><strong>Note if and when your cat withdraws from company.</strong></li>
          <p>A stressed cat may hide away under a bed or in a dark corner. She is literally hiding, hoping to avoid the attention of what is stressing her.</p>
          <br>

          <img src="images/image8.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 8.">

        <li><strong>Keep track of any changes of appetite.</strong></li>
          <p>Some stressed cats lose their appetite, while others start to eat strange things, like chewing on a towel.</p>
          <br>

          <img src="images/image9.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 9.">

        <li><strong>Determine the cause of your cat's stress.</strong></li>
          <p>Try to pinpoint when the symptoms started and why. This can help you take action to reduce the source of stress, whether it is physical, environmental, or psychological. Your vet will also want to know when you first noticed the symptoms.</p>

     <ol>
       <li><strong>Take your cat to a veterinarian to see if health troubles exist. </strong></li>
         <p>Many stress symptoms can also be symptoms of physical illness. You need to know if you're dealing with a sick cat or a stressed cat (in some cases the former may cause the latter).</p>
         <br>

        <img src="images/image11.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 11.">

      <li><strong>Trim claws that have grown painfully long. </strong></li>
        <p>Sometimes the cause of physical stress is simple to resolve, such as overgrown claws digging into her pads.</p>
        <br>

        <img src="images/image12.jpg"alt="Image titled Reduce Stress in Cats Step 12.">

      <li><strong>Eradicate a flea infestation.</strong></li>
        <p>Fleas bite the skin and irritate your cat;[12] what's worse, if ingested they can lead to a tapeworm parasite infection. If your cat is scratching frequently and persistently, perform a simple spot check. Buy a fine-tooth comb and run it through her fur around the base of the neck and tail: if you see small, brown shapes about the size of a pin-head, your cat has fleas. Also look for white or black spots between the teeth of the comb: these are flea eggs and dried blood excreted by the fleas, respectively. If you find fleas, you'll need to get rid of them on your cat, and in your home.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>To eliminate fleas on your cat, consult your veterinarian for recommendations on a flea-control program that's right for her.</li>
            <li>At home, you'll need to take measures that include: rigorous vacuuming of all your cat's favorite places, rugs, and upholstery; washing your cat's bedding weekly; and possibly using a spray, fogger, or powder that is safe (follow product directions carefully and make sure the cat is not in the area if that is specified in the instructions).</li>
          </ul>
